## ✨ What This Project Demonstrates

This application showcases how to **build an AI-powered MCP client** that understands natural language:

- **Natural Language Processing** - Send commands like "Create a file called notes.txt with my meeting notes"
- **Intelligent Agent** - AI automatically determines which operation to perform (CREATE, READ, EDIT, DELETE)
- **Unified API** - Single endpoint handles all file operations through conversational commands
- **Tool Orchestration** - AI agent automatically selects and invokes the correct MCP tools
